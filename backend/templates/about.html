        <p>
          Distributed ESP32 nodes collect air and water data around Turkey Point.
          Readings are sent to the server over HTTPS and interpreted with a lightweight AI layer
          to highlight unusual patterns. Data is stored for transparency and trend analysis.
        </p>

          <li>Modular nodes with 3D-printed enclosures</li>
          <li>Ground sensors: radiation, PM2.5, temperature, humidity, pressure, VOC</li>
          <li>Water sensors: temperature, turbidity, TDS, pH</li>
          <li>Server stores readings and computes status updates</li>

          This system does not replace official safety systems. It provides an additional layer
          of public transparency.
